# Navarrete Project

Welcome to the **Navarrete Project**! This project is built using **SvelteKit**, a framework for building fast, modern web applications.

## üìñ What is SvelteKit?

**SvelteKit** is a modern web development framework that leverages the Svelte compiler to create highly optimized and reactive web applications. Unlike traditional frameworks, SvelteKit compiles code to JavaScript at build time, resulting in faster performance and smaller bundle sizes. It provides both front-end and server-side capabilities, making it ideal for building full-stack applications.

### Key Features

- **Reactive Components**: Write reactive code with minimal boilerplate.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Render pages on the server for better SEO and performance.
- **File-Based Routing**: Built-in routing based on the file structure.
- **API Routes**: Define serverless functions directly in the project for backend logic.
- **Optimized Builds**: Compiles and optimizes code for production.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

To set up the project, clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git
cd project-name
npm install
```

### Running the Project

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to view the app in development mode. The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.

### Building for Production

To build the app for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

The output will be in the `build` directory. You can preview the production build locally with:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## üìÇ Project Structure

Here‚Äôs an overview of the main directories in this project:

- **src/routes**: Contains all pages and API endpoints. Each `.svelte` file in this folder is treated as a route. Folders with a `+page.svelte` or `+layout.svelte` structure define route hierarchies.
- **src/lib/components**: Reusable UI components for the application.
- **src/lib/stores**: Svelte stores for managing application state.
- **src/lib/styles**: Global and component-specific styles.
- **src/lib/types**: Data models and type definitions for entities like `Product`, `User`, etc.
- **src/lib/utils**: Utility functions for common logic, such as data formatting or validations.

## üìÑ Adding New Pages and API Endpoints

To add a new page:

1. Create a `.svelte` file in `src/routes`. For example, creating `src/routes/about.svelte` will create a route at `/about`.
2. To add a dynamic route, use square brackets in the file name. For example, `src/routes/products/[id].svelte` will create a dynamic route at `/products/:id`.

To add an API endpoint:

1. Create a `+server.js` file in `src/routes/api`. For example, creating `src/routes/api/products/+server.js` will create an API route at `/api/products`.
2. Define your endpoint logic using `GET`, `POST`, etc., to handle different HTTP methods.

## üîë Key Dependencies

- **Svelte**: Core library for building reactive components.
- **SvelteKit**: Framework that extends Svelte with routing, SSR, and more.
- **Vite**: Fast bundler and development server used by SvelteKit.
